# Stroke-Code

Stroke Code Rapid Response Tool with three integrated sections:
Features:
1. NIH Stroke Scale Calculator

Complete 15-item assessment with all proper scoring criteria
Real-time total score calculation (0-42 range)
Automatic severity interpretation (minor, moderate, severe)
All items include proper descriptors for accurate bedside assessment

2. Stroke Code Checklist

Last known well/symptom onset time tracking with automatic time window calculation
Critical vital parameters (BP, glucose)
Laboratory values (INR, platelets)
Clinical history checklist (anticoagulation, recent surgery, etc.)
Time-sensitive alerts for IV tPA window (0-4.5 hours) and thrombectomy window (0-24 hours)

3. tPA Eligibility Assessment

Automated contraindication screening based on entered data
Color-coded alerts for absolute contraindications vs. cautions
BP threshold checking (>185/110 requires treatment)
Glucose range verification
Extended window considerations (3-4.5 hours)
Standard dosing reference (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg)
Mechanical thrombectomy criteria

The tool follows AHA/ASA Guidelines for acute ischemic stroke management and provides immediate decision support during time-critical stroke codes.

I've added a comprehensive Resources tab to your stroke code tool. The new tab includes:
